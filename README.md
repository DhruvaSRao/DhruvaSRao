## Hey There! I'm Dhruva S Rao 👋🏻

I'm currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science at BMS College of Engineering in Bangalore. My focus lies primarily in mastering the MERN Stack development and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and I'm particularly enthusiastic about Competitive Programming, constantly seeking to enhance my problem-solving abilities and algorithmic skills. Throughout my academic journey, I've been actively involved in diverse projects where I've had the opportunity to develop websites catering to specific client needs. These experiences have honed my technical skills and strengthened my understanding of real-world application development. 

Looking ahead, my ambition is to establish myself as a proficient software engineer, leveraging my expertise in problem-solving to create innovative solutions. I'm passionate about tackling challenging problems head-on, and I believe this drive will propel me toward achieving my goals in the dynamic field of software development.
